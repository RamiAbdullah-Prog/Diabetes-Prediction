---

![Project Overview](Diabetes_Prediction_Image.jpg)


#### **Introduction:**
This project aims to apply machine learning techniques to develop a predictive model capable of determining the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes based on various health-related features. Diabetes is a prevalent chronic disease, and early prediction can help in its management and prevention. This project will explore relationships between key factors such as age, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, glucose levels, and family history to predict the risk of diabetes.

---

#### **Project Objective:**
The objective of this project is to:
- Build a predictive model using a dataset containing individual health features such as age, BMI, glucose levels, insulin, and family history.
- Identify the most influential factors that contribute to the development of diabetes.
- Provide a machine learning solution that predicts the likelihood of diabetes in unseen test data.

#### **Dataset:**
The project will rely on the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**, which includes the following columns:
- **Outcome:** The target variable (0 = No Diabetes, 1 = Diabetes).
- **Pregnancies:** Number of pregnancies the individual has had.
- **Glucose:** Plasma glucose concentration.
- **BloodPressure:** Diastolic blood pressure.
- **SkinThickness:** Skinfold thickness.
- **Insulin:** Insulin level.
- **BMI:** Body Mass Index (BMI).
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction:** A function representing the family history of diabetes.
- **Age:** Age of the individual.

#### **Methodology:**

1. **Stage 1: Data Exploration (Data Exploration):**
   - Explore the general distribution of the dataset using visualizations such as **histograms**, **scatter plots**, and **correlation matrices**.
   - Identify columns with missing values, outliers, and perform an initial analysis of the dataset.

2. **Stage 2: Data Preprocessing:**
   - **Handling Missing Values:** Use techniques like replacing missing values with the **mean** or **median** for numerical columns (e.g., BMI, Age) and **mode** for categorical columns.
   - **Outlier Handling:** Detect and address outliers in critical features such as **glucose** and **insulin** to ensure robust model performance.
   - **Feature Engineering:** Normalize or standardize certain features like **BMI** and **glucose** to enhance model convergence.

3. **Stage 3: Feature Encoding and Selection:**
   - **Feature Encoding:** Convert categorical features (e.g., Outcome) into numeric representations.
   - **Feature Selection:** Evaluate the importance of each feature using techniques like **correlation matrices** and **feature importance** to identify the most relevant ones.

4. **Stage 4: Model Building:**
   - Implement various machine learning models to create the predictive model, including:
     - **Logistic Regression** for probabilistic classification.
     - **Decision Tree Classifier** for capturing non-linear relationships.
     - **Random Forest Classifier** for improved performance through an ensemble approach.
     - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** for margin-based classification.

5. **Stage 5: Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate each model using metrics such as **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-Score**, and **AUC**.
   - Compare the models' performances to select the most accurate one for final prediction.

6. **Stage 6: Prediction and Submission:**
   - Use the best-performing model to predict the diabetes outcomes for an unseen test dataset.
   - Prepare the results in the required format for submission.

#### **Proposed Models:**
- **Logistic Regression:** A simple and interpretable linear model useful for binary classification tasks.
- **Decision Tree Classifier (DTC):** A non-linear model that partitions data based on a series of decisions, easy to interpret and visualize.
- **Random Forest Classifier (RFC):** An ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees to improve performance and reduce overfitting.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** A powerful model that works well for classification tasks by finding the optimal hyperplane.

#### **Techniques and Tools:**
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries Used:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning Techniques:** **Supervised Learning**, **Classification Models**

---

#### **Expected Outcomes:**
- The project aims to build an accurate model that predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on the available health features.
- The expected performance for the diabetes prediction model is to achieve **75% to 85%** accuracy, depending on the quality of data preprocessing and model tuning. However, the final results will be determined based on the small dataset available to us.

---

#### **Challenges:**
- **Handling Missing Data:** Some columns may have missing values, which could affect the modelâ€™s performance. Techniques like imputation will be used to address this.
- **Outliers:** Extreme values in features like glucose and insulin could skew the results, requiring careful handling.
- **Imbalanced Classes:** The target variable may be imbalanced, with fewer positive cases (diabetes) than negative cases, necessitating techniques like **SMOTE** or **class weighting**.

---

#### **Expected Results:**
- Deliver a functional machine learning model that accurately predicts diabetes risk for individuals based on key health indicators.
- Identify and analyze the most significant health factors influencing diabetes development, such as **BMI**, **glucose levels**, and **age**.
